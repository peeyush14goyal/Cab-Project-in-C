<b>About Project</b>
<p>
An event is occuring in some city. We have been given the responsibility to escort Guests to the event place.
We have been given the arrival time of each Guest.
We have a set of cars with drivers. Using this software you can get the order in which cars will be going.
Till now it all seems to be like a Competitive Programming problem. Lets's now make it real...
  We can perform CRUD operations on both Driver and Guest Records.
  For <b>v1.0</b> We are considering 7-day event.
  </p>
  
  <h2><b>Real life scenarios</b></h2>
  <ol><li>Car may get broken< = <b>Solution</b> => At start of each day we are asked to enter the times at which car will get broken and then algorithm will run again to allot the cars to go</li></ol>
  
  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <ol><li>Guest are arriving from one place only</li>
  <li>Time taken to complete the round trip is 3 hours</li></ol>
